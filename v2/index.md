## Why and Features

### SSHScript: A Simple and Intuitive Way to Automate Common SSH Tasks

SSHScript is a Python library that provides a simple and intuitive way to automate common tasks that involve running commands and dealing with outputs on local and remote hosts. SSHScript makes it easy to write scripts that can connect to remote hosts via SSH and execute commands, and it allows you to process the resulting data directly in Python. This enables you to build complex data structures and processing flows using an object-oriented approach.

### Benefits of using SSHScript

- Easy to use: If you know what commands to run and which host to connect to via SSH, you can write your script without having to learn any extra concepts.

- Intuitive and self-explanatory: Embedding shell commands in Python scripts is intuitive and self-explanatory, making it easy to collaborate and maintain your scripts.

- Easier handling of outputs and exceptions: Handling execution outputs and exceptions is easier in Python than it is in shell scripts.

- Leverage the Python ecosystem: Your scripts can leverage the vast ecosystem of Python packages.

- Parallel execution support: SSHScript supports parallel execution of commands using threads.

### Use cases

SSHScript can be used for a variety of tasks, including:

- Provisioning and configuration: SSHScript can be used to automate the provisioning and configuration of servers, networks, and other devices.

- Data collection and processing: SSHScript can be used to collect data from remote hosts and process it in Python. This can be useful for tasks such as monitoring, logging, and reporting.

- Deployment and testing: SSHScript can be used to deploy and test software on remote hosts.

- Troubleshooting and maintenance: SSHScript can be used to troubleshoot and maintain remote systems.

- Overall, SSHScript is a powerful and flexible tool that can be used to automate a wide range of common SSH tasks. It is easy to use and learn, and it provides a number of benefits over traditional shell scripting.
