##  ðŸ”µ <a name="effective_session"></a> Every Thread has an Effective Session.

The "session" here means an instance of SSHScriptSession. Initially, SSHScript creates a session for the main thread.
All commands executed by the initial session are executed by the subprocess module on localhost.
"All commands" includes one-dollar, two-dollars and with-dollar commands.

```
## This command "hostname" would be executed by the subprocess module. 
## Because the effective session is the initial sesssion of the main thread.
$hostname
```

If the initial session was connecting to a remote server. A new instance of SSHScriptSession would be returned by the $.connect() method.
The new instance of SSHScriptSession would become the "effective session" of the main thread.

```
with $.connect('user@remotehost'):
    ## This command "hostname" would be executed by the paramiko module
    ## Because the effective session is the new instance of SSHScriptSession returned by $.connect()
    $hostname
```

SSHScript attaches every dollar-commands to a session to execute it.
For doing that, SSHScript binds a session to every thread, that session is the effective session of the thread.

Every thread carries a stack to hold sessions. Initially, the stack of main thread has one element -- the initial session.
A new connection creates a new session and that session would be put on the stack top to be the effective session.
And it would be pull out of the stack when it was closed.

```
## Initial session would execute the following commands on localhost by subprocess module.
$hostname
$whoami
## The new session would become the effective session of main thread
with $.connect('user@remotehost'):
    ## the effective session which is connected to remotehost would execute the following commands
    $hostname
    $whoami
## Initial session would execute the following commands on localhost by subprocess module.
## Since connection to remotehost is closed.
$hostname
$whoami
```

##  ðŸ”µ <a name="functions"></a>Let functions come into play

Usually we got so many runtines to execute on many hosts.
We could use functions to do the same thing on every host.
By updating the function, it applies to all hosts.

Here is an example:
```
def get_date():
    $date
    profile = {'dat':$.stdout.strip()}
    return profile

profile = {'localhost':get_date()}
accounts = ['user@hostA','user@hostB']
for account in accounts:
    with $.connect(account):
        profile[account] = get_date()
```

##  ðŸ”µ <a name="threads"></a>Let Threads come into play

For some reason that we would use thread.

Here is an example:
```
def get_date(profile):
    $date
    profile['date'] = $.stdout.strip()

def get_diskspace(profile):
    $df
    profile['df'] = $.stdout.strip()

def connect(account,profile):
    with $.connect(account) as remote:
        $hostname
        hostname = $.stdout.strip()
        profile[hostname] = {}
        get_date(profile[hostname])
        get_diskspace(profile[hostname])

profile = {}
accounts = ['user@hostA','user@hostB']
threads = []
for account in accounts:
    thread = $.thread(target=get_profile,args=[account,profile])
    thread.start()
    threads.append(thread)
for thread in threads:
    thread.join()
print(profile)
```

In the above example, the "get_date()" and "get_disksapce()" functions were called by different threads.
It is fine because the effective session of threads are different.

##  ðŸ”µ <a name="bind"></a>session.bind(),session.thread(): Binding a session to threads or functions

SSHScript 2.0 supports a session connects to multiple hosts at the same time.
When connecting to multiple hosts, the effective session is the last connection made.
What if you want to execute commands on previous sessions?
That is why "session.bind()" comes into play.
The effective session of a thread or a function could be arbitrary assigned by "session.bind()".

Here is an example.
```
def get_hostname():
    $hostname
    return $.stdout.strip()
    
def get_date(profile):
    $date
    profile['date'] = $.stdout.strip()
    return profile

def zone_job(accounts,zoneprofile):
    for account in accounts:
        with $.connect(account):
            get_date(zoneprofile)

profile = {'zone1':{}, 'zone2':{}, 'zone3':{}}
## these hosts are behind bridge1
accountsZone1 = ['user@zone1HostA','user@zone1HostB']
## these hosts are behind bridge2
accountsZone2 = ['user@zone2HostA','user@zone2HostB']
## these hosts are behind bridge3
accountsZone3 = ['user@zone3HostA','user@zone3HostB']

## connect to the bridge host 
bridgeSession1 = $.connect('user@bridge1')
bridgeSession2 = $.connect('user@bridge2')
bridgeSession3 = $.connect('user@bridge3')

## the effective session is the last connection made.
hostname = get_hostname()
assert  hostname == 'bridge3'

## session.bind(func) returns a new function
## that calls func() by taking bridgeSession1 as its effective session.
hostname = bridgeSession1.bind(get_hostname)()
assert  hostname == 'bridge1'
hostname = bridgeSession2.bind(get_hostname)()
assert  hostname == 'bridge2'

## the effective session of thread1 is the last connection made (aka. bridgeSession3)
thread1 = threading.thread(target=zone_job,args=[accountsZone1,profile['zone1']])
## session.bind(thread) would set the binding session to be the effective session of this thread
bridgeSession1.bind(thread1)

## session.thread() is a handly function for doing the same thing.
thread2 = bridgeSession2.thread(target=zone_job,args=[accountsZone2,profile['zone2']])

## the effective session of thread3 is the last connection made (aka. bridgeSession3)
thread3 = threading.thread(target=zone_job,args=[accountsZone3,profile['zone3']])

thread1.start()
thread2.start()
thread3.start()
thread1.join()
thread2.join()
thread3.join()
bridgeSession1.close()
bridgeSession2.close()
bridgeSession3.close()
print(profile)
```
