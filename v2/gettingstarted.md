## Check Installation

After you have installed the SSHScript. let us check if it works. The SSHScript would install a cli named "sshscript". You can open a console and typing "sshscript" to check if it works.

```
$ sshscript
```

If it works, you would have screen like below:
(image of "sshscript")

If you don't have that screen, you might have to modify the PATH environment variable
of your shell. You can find the path of "sshscript" by running the following command:

```
$ python3 -c 'import sysconfig; print(sysconfig.get_path("scripts"))'
```
