Once you have installed SSHScript, you can check if it is working by running the sshscript command in a terminal.

```
$ sshscript
```

If SSHScript is installed correctly, you will see a screen like this:

If you do not see this screen, you may need to modify your shell's PATH environment variable to include the path to the SSHScript CLI. You can find the path to the SSHScript CLI by running the following command:

```
$ python3 -c 'import sysconfig; print(sysconfig.get_path("scripts"))'
```
Once you have the path to the SSHScript CLI, you can add it to your PATH environment variable. For example, to add the path to your PATH environment variable in Bash, you would run the following command:

```
export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/sshscript
```

## ðŸ”µ <a name="check-works"></a> Checking if SSHScript works

SSHScript works in two ways: SSHScript dollar-syntax and python module.

### SSHScript dollar-syntax

SSHScript adds additional syntax that could used in regular python statements.
Because those additional syntax are started with $(dollar), so it is called dollar-syntax.

A python script with dollar-syntax is excuted by the SSHScript CLI "sshscript" command.

For example:
```
$hostname
print($.stdout.strip())
```
This two-lines example would execute command "hostname" and print the output on stdout.
To run it, please save it as "example.spy", then in the console, runs:
```
sshscript example.spy
```

### SSHScript module

SSHScript v2.0 has refined the functionality of module for users who can use sshscript without written syntax-dollar.
It is also easier to use SSHScript module when integrating with existing projects.

For example:
```
import sshscript
session = sshscript.SSHScriptSession()
session(hostname)
print(session.stdout.strip())
```
This example would execute command "hostname" and print the output on stdout, too.
To run it, please save it as "example.py", then in the console, runs:
```
python3 example.py
```

### The difference between SSHScript dollar-syntax and module


Once you have added the path to your PATH environment variable, you should be able to run the sshscript command from anywhere in your terminal.
